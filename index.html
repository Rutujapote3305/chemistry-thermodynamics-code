            <h1>CHEMISTRY</h1>
            <p>Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter.It is a physical science within the natural sciences</p>
            <p> that studies the chemical elements that make up matter and compounds made of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure,</p> 
            <p>properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during reactions with other substances.Chemistry also addresses the nature of chemical</p>
            <p>bonds in chemical compounds.</p><br><br>

     <h2>THERMODYNAMICS.</h2>
       <p>Thermodynamics deals with the concepts of heat and temperature and the inter-conversion of heat and other forms of energy</p>
       
       <P>Thermodynamics is not concerned about how and at what rate these energy transformations are carried out. It is based on</P>
       
       <p>the initial and final states undergoing the change. It should also be noted that Thermodynamics is a macroscopic science.</p>
       
       <p>This means that it deals with the bulk system and does not deal with the molecular constitution of matter.</P>

        <h2>THERMODYNAMICS SYSTEMS</h2>
        <p>A thermodynamic system is a specific portion of matter with a definite boundary on which our attention is focused.</p>
        <p>The system boundary may be real or imaginary, fixed or deformable. </p>

        <h2>Types of Systems.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Isolated System</li>
             <p>An isolated system cannot exchange energy and mass with its surroundings. 
                The universe is considered an isolated system.</p>
             
             <li>Closed System</li>
             <p>Across the boundary of the closed system, the transfer of energy takes place but the transfer of mass doesn’t take place. 
                Refrigerator, compression of gas in the piston-cylinder assembly are examples of closed systems.</p>
            
             <li>Open System</li>
             <p>In an open system, the mass and energy both may be transferred between the system and surroundings.
                A steam turbine is an example of an open system.</p>
        </ul>
