      <h2 style="color:rgb(85, 65, 65);">Second Law of Thermodynamics</h2>

      <p>The second law of thermodynamics states that any spontaneously occurring process will always lead to an escalation 
        in the entropy (S) of the universe. In simple words, the law explains that an isolated system’s entropy will never 
        decrease over time.</p>

        <p>Mathematically, the second law of thermodynamics is represented as</p>
           <p>ΔSuniv > 0</p>

          <p>Where</p>
            <p>ΔSuniv is the change in the entropy of the universe.

            Entropy is a measure of the randomness of the system, or it is the measure of energy or chaos within an isolated system.
            It can be considered a quantitative index that describes the quality of energy.
            
            Meanwhile, there are a few factors that cause an increase in the entropy of the closed system. Firstly, in a closed system,
             while the mass remains constant, there is an exchange of heat with the surroundings. This change in the heat content creates
              a disturbance in the system, thereby increasing the entropy of the system.
            
            Secondly, internal changes may occur in the movements of the molecules of the system. This leads to disturbances which further
             cause irreversibilities inside the system resulting in the increment of its entropy.</p>
