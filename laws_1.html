      <h2 style="color:rgb(85, 65, 65);">First Law of Thermodynamics</h2>

      <p>The First Law of Thermodynamics states that heat is a form of energy, and thermodynamic processes are therefore 
        subject to the principle of conservation of energy. This means that heat energy cannot be created or destroyed.
         It can, however, be transferred from one location to another and converted to and from other forms of energy.</p>

      <p>According to this law, some heat given to the system is used to change the internal energy while the rest is used in 
        doing work by the system.

        It can be represented mathematically as</p>
         <p>ΔQ = ΔU+W</p>
         
        <p>Where,
        
        ΔQ is the heat given or lost
        ΔU is the change in internal energy
        W is the work done
        We can also represent the above equation as follows,</p>

        <p>ΔU = ΔQ-W</p>
         
        <p>So we can infer from the above equation that the quantity (ΔQ – W) is independent of the path taken to change the state. 
        Further, we can say that internal energy increases when the heat is given to the system and vice versa.</p>
