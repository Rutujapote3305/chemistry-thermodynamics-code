      <h2 style="color:rgb(85, 65, 65);">Third Law of Thermodynamics</h2>

      <p>The third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a perfect crystal at a temperature of zero Kelvin
         (absolute zero) is equal to zero.</p>

      <p>At a temperature of zero Kelvin, the following phenomena can be observed in a closed system:</p>
         <p>The system does not contain any heat.</p>
         
        <p>All the atoms and molecules in the system are at their lowest energy points.</p>

       <p>Therefore, a system at absolute zero has only one accessible microstate – it’s ground state. As per the third law of
         thermodynamics, the entropy of such a system is exactly zero.</p>

        <p>This law was developed by the German chemist Walther Nernst between the years 1906 and 1912.</p>
         
        <p>The Nernst statement of the third law of thermodynamics implies that it is not possible for a process to bring
           the entropy of a given system to zero in a finite number of operations.</p>

       <P>Another implication of the third law of thermodynamics is: the exchange of energy between two thermodynamic systems</p>
